			Former CEO and Co-Founder of Microsoft, the world largest PC software company. Bill Gates is my hero not just because he 
			is one of the greatest minds of the 20th and 21st century who was prolific in driving the paradigm shift of advancement 
			in computers, but the face that he is also philanthropist who believe in making the world a better place especially through 
			the eradication of communicable diseases and helping the less forturnate accesss facilitate  and opportunity that are inherently inaccessible.
